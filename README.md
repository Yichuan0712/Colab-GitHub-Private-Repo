# Accessing Private GitHub Repositories in Google Colab

This repository provides a guide for setting up a connection to a private GitHub repository from Google Colab. 

### Step 1: Setup

Run the `step_1.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to set up the SSH key and GitHub configuration. This setup only needs to be completed once.

### Step 2: Everyday Use

After you've completed the initial setup in `step_1.ipynb`, for all subsequent Colab sessions, you only need to run `step_2.ipynb` to connect to your private GitHub repositories with the existing SSH key.
