# Colab-GitHub Private Repo Connection

This repository provides a detailed guide for setting up a connection to a private GitHub repository from Google Colab. 

### Step 1: Setup

Run the `step_1.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to set up your SSH keys and GitHub configuration. This setup only needs to be completed once.

### Step 2: Everyday Use

After you've completed the initial setup in `step_1.ipynb`, for all subsequent Colab sessions, you only need to use the code provided in `step_2.ipynb`. This notebook contains streamlined commands to quickly set up your environment with the existing SSH keys and connect to your private GitHub repositories.
